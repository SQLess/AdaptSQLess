# AdaptSQLess

## Abstract

SQL query simplification reduces the length of a lengthy SQL query in different contexts, facilitating debugging and patching in DBMSs.

SQLess is a dialect-agnostic approach for simplifying SQL queries. SQLess effectively reduces the sizes of queries
generated by state-of-the-art DBMS fuzzers.It is built on the foundation of ANTLR.

The workflow encompasses two main components: adaptive parser (AdaptParser) and query trimmer (SQLess). It contains two steps: Adaptive parsing and SQL Query Trimming.



## How to use

The first step involves using the Adaptive Parser to generate a parser  that adapts to various dialects. 

[Adaptive Parser](AdaptParser\README.md)

Then, we will apply a trimming strategy on the SQL Query Trimmer.
